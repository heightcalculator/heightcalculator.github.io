# Height Calculator 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to **Height Calculator**, a super simple web tool I built to help you crunch numbers on heights—whether you're comparing kids' growth, planning furniture, or just curious about conversions (like feet to cm). Drop in some measurements, hit calculate, and boom—instant results with visuals. No fluff, just what you need.
